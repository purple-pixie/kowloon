picking up
pairs+
runs >=3

placing
place on either matching axis
place on lowest z possible

scoring
complete line
triple for all matching or a run 1-6
diagonals score only if perfect 1-6

outside lines score the outside pips also

===========================
at most 3 distinct sets
"best pick" option (most dice)



check for 2 runs
	get first run up to 3
	if second run, that's all 6 so ship it
	else check for any remaining pairs
	
if not found 6:
	for each run (starting from 2)
	
---------
every possible case:
	run of 6 - done
	run of 5 - consider as (either of 2 different) run of 4
	run of 4 - could be 4-run + 2-set
		could be 2x run of 3
		could be (either of 2 different) 3-run + 2-set (better than just 4-run)
		couild be an equally-sized but more usable 2x 2-set
	run of 3 - could be 2x run of 3
	
	after no six found including a run:
		sextext ez return 6
		5-set ez return 5
		4-set, check for 4+2, else return 4
		3-set, check for 2x 3-set or 3 + 2 return best
		2-set, check for 2x or 3x pair, return best
